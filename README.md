Parsing Using OSSP Jsoup
===
### Reasons for Project Selection
---
With the development of the Internet and the spread of smartphones, people are more easily accessing and using the Internet. Rather than seeing the situation go by reading the newspaper, the world received information more quickly and easily by accessing Internet news stories, articles using smartphones, tablet PCs and laptops. As with anything that has net functionality, adverse effects exist. These developments have helped make communication in the virtual world more frequent, smoother, and more anonymous, leaving people less guilty and unable to speak out in the real world. Not only public figures but also friends, acquaintances, or the family, can be victims or perpetrators. So I use jsoups to page social networking sites or social communities, and I hope people who are suffering will be eliminated in the end due to abusive comments, abusive language, or slandering the Internet. The group also chose the project to help solve social problems caused by malicious comments and recommend proper netiquette.
